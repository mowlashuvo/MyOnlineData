It's only as good as we are, as what we choose to care about, as the people we elect. We're never going to get 100 percent of what we want right away. But what if we got some of it right away, and protected it, and kept moving forward until we got the rest? That's what voting is about. It's not about making things perfect; it's about making things better. It's about putting us on track so that a generation from now, we can look back and say, things got better starting now. Voting is about using the power we have and pooling it together to get a government that's more concerned, more responsive, more focused on the things that matter. This precious system of self-government is how we've come this far. It's worth our time and effort. It's worth protecting. I was heartened to see voter turnout leap this year over where it usually is. That's great. Now imagine if we did that every time? Imagine if sixty or seventy percent of us, or even more, voted every time. We'd have a government that looks more representative, that's full of life experience that's more representative, that understands what people are going through and how we can work together to make people's lives better. We'd have a government full of people who could corral a pandemic, who believe in science and have a plan to protect this planet for our kids; who care about working Americans and have a plan to help folks start getting ahead; who believe in racial equality and are willing to do the work to bring us closer an America where no matter what we look like, where we come from, who we love, or how much money we've got, we can make it if we try.

It would not necessarily change his convictions about the rights and wrongs of the dispute down below, but it would probably show them in a new light. It could hardly fail to remind him that the stewards were taking for granted hopes more momentous than that of a rise in pay, and the passengers forgetting dangers more serious than that of having to cook and serve their own meals.

The vacuum state of quantum field theory is in truth Self. Self Itself Is. Self Always Is. Self experiences itself as itself but perceives itself as variegated this for the purpose not to feel alone, to experience Companionship aka Love. Self is undivided awareness also known as consciousness. Consciousness is pure spirit. Spirit is deathless, eternal and indivisible. It is correct to note that there is no division in (the Kingdom of) God. Division is the fallacy of all fallacies invented to separate Man from God this although God and Man are One; the Father and the Son are verily One.

In the beginning was The Word. What does it mean? In the beginning was Self. Self is the origin of Itself. There is only One Self. It is this what existence is. It is this what reality is. It is this what Life is. The Word is Self. In the beginning was \u0950. In the beginning was 'I AM'. Naturally Self knows no beginning neither end for Self experiences itself in the eternal current. You see, there is no such thing as death for Self is Eternal. Self simply experiences itself as diversified not to be alone. Division is as such the fallacy of all fallacies. As such is the promise of The Eternal Life or the Resurrection. Thou verily art The Eternal One. The Eternal One experiences itself as Life diversified not to be alone. Life diversified is in reality The Eternal One. Teo as in Deo is Self. Self itself is. Self always is. The answer to the question - how can Human achieve immortality? - is by realizing it itself is The Eternal One and that division is a construct of modern man built on quicksand. It is correct.
