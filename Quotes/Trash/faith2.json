That the Reformation started with Luther's protest against this traffic in indulgences proves its religious origin and evangelical character. At issue here was nothing less than the essential character of the gospel, the core of Christianity, the nature of true piety. And Luther was the man who, guided by experience in the life of his own soul, again made people understand the original and true meaning of the gospel of Christ. Like the righteousness of God, so the term penitence had been for him one of the most bitter words of Holy Scripture. But when from Romans 1:17 he learned to know a righteousness by faith, he also learned the true manner of penitence. He then understood that the repentance demanded in Matthew 4:17 had nothing to do with the works of satisfaction required in the Roman institution of confession, but consisted in a change of mind in true interior contrition and with all its benefits was itself a fruit of grace. In the first seven of his ninety-five theses and further in his sermon on Indulgences and Grace (February 1518), the sermon on Penitence (March 1518), and the sermon on the Sacrament of Penance (1519), he set forth this meaning of repentance or conversion and developed the glorious thought that the most important part of penitence consists not in private confession (which cannot be found in Scripture) nor in satisfaction (for God forgives sins freely) but in true sorrow over sin, in a solemn resolve to bear the cross of Christ, in a new life, and in the word of absolution, that is, the word of the grace of God in Christ. The penitent arrives at forgiveness of sins, not by making amends (satisfaction) and priestly absolution, but by trusting the word of God, by believing in God's grace. It is not the sacrament but faith that justifies. In that way Luther came to again put sin and grace in the center of the Christian doctrine of salvation. The forgiveness of sins, that is, justification, does not depend on repentance, which always remains incomplete, but rests in God's promise and becomes ours by faith alone.\n  \"",

In the beginning was The Word. What does it mean? In the beginning was Self. Self is the origin of Itself. There is only One Self. It is this what existence is. It is this what reality is. It is this what Life is. The Word is Self. In the beginning was \u0950. In the beginning was 'I AM'. Naturally Self knows no beginning neither end for Self experiences itself in the eternal current. You see, there is no such thing as death for Self is Eternal. Self simply experiences itself as diversified not to be alone. Division is as such the fallacy of all fallacies. As such is the promise of The Eternal Life or the Resurrection. Thou verily art The Eternal One. The Eternal One experiences itself as Life diversified not to be alone. Life diversified is in reality The Eternal One. Teo as in Deo is Self. Self itself is. Self always is. The answer to the question - how can Human achieve immortality? - is by realizing it itself is The Eternal One and that division is a construct of modern man built on quicksand. It is correct.

You focused on hygiene, nourishing meals, a pleasing home that always smelled good. That was your achievement and more important that was you.
